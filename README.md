# Rizzler Ghost
## About this project
I'm developing a small 2D puzzle game using Unity.  
This project remains unfinished, and I've made this repository public for those curious individuals interested in tracking my progress.  

### Who is Rizzler the Ghost?
'Rizzler' is a ghost with superpowers that give them the ability to conjure an endless amount of magnets from thin air and control them.  
Rizzler is also quite the gentleghost who has the power to make anyone fall in love with them simply by smiling at them.  
  
We embark on our journey with Rizzler as they begin to discover their powers. As the game unfolds, our spectral hero acquires additional abilities that makes manipulating the magnets easier.  
Rizzler Ghost is a challenging video game, currently featuring World 1 (W1) comprising 14 levels (+ tutorial). In these levels, your task is to launch magnet balls at magnetic boxes in order to finally reach the end of your journey.  
## What's next for the project?
Another world (W2) is in the making that completely differs from W1. W2 will offer 14 levels and a tutorial but the mechanics will be entirely different compared to W1.  
In W2, Rizzler has acquired the ability to control the magnet balls through the air for a limited time.
